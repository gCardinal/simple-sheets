validation
===

Surprise, surprise! Thin abstraction over validation lib. Though,
this one I'm not sure makes sense. `superstruct` is function based,
so I guess it's not impossible for a switch to be non-disruptive if
the new library is also function based, but I'm not sure.

Maybe I'll try switching eventually just for the fun of it.
